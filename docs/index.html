        <h1>Welcome to Passenger-WSGI-test</h1>
        <p>This site hosts several scripts to test Python (Django, Flask, WSGI) apps running with Phusion Passenger in an Apache 2.4 vhost.</p>
        <p>There's also some notes on other WSGI modules (mod_wsgi, mod_uwsgi) to allow Python to run through Apache 2.4</p>
        <p>And some, non exhaustive, notes about Shared Hosting providers that offer Phusion Passenger as an option in their service.</p>
        <p>There here so it's easy to find them, and hopefully they can save you some time if you find them useful.</p>

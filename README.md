# Passenger-WSGI-test
WSGI test scripts for Phusion Passenger and Apache 2.4 mod_passenger

1. This site hosts several scripts to test Python (Django, Flask, WSGI) apps running with Phusion Passenger in an Apache 2.4 vhost.

2. There's also some notes on other WSGI modules (mod_wsgi, mod_uwsgi) to allow Python to run through Apache 2.4

3. And some, non exhaustive, notes about Shared Hosting providers that offer Phusion Passenger as an option in their service.

4. They're here so it's easy to find them, and hopefully they can save you some time if you find them useful.
